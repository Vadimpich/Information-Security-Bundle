# Information-Security-Bundle
After studying the topic of information security, I wanted to develop software that could help people keep their data safe. Since I learned the Pascal programming language at school, I decided to choose it for writing code. The development environment was FormsABC - the training module of the program PascalABC.NET to work with the simplest windowed applications.
I decided to call a set of three programs "Information Security Bundle".

The first program of the kit was "Universal Coding Instrument" - a tool that allows you to encrypt any text, be it a personal message, password or just a set of letters. The encryption is done by applying a variation of the Caesar cipher I invented to the text. When encrypting a message, the user enters a text, and at the output receives an encrypted message and a special 20-character key. If the user wants to decrypt the message, then it is enough for him to enter the cipher and the key in special fields, after which he will receive the decrypted text. 

The second program I developed was "Password Master". The name of the application speaks for itself â€“ it is designed to check the password for reliability, as well as to generate secure passwords according to certain criteria.

The final, third program of the kit is "Password Keeper". This application will allow users to securely store accounts on their computer. All data is stored in encrypted form, and to log in to the program, you need to enter the master password that the user sets when the application is first launched. This program combines elements of the two previous ones, since all credentials are encrypted by the algorithm from the 1st program, and passwords are checked for reliability by the method from the 2nd program.
