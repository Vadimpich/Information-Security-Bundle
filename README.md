# Information-Security-Bundle
After studying the topic of information security, I wanted to develop software that could help people keep their data safe. Since I learned the Pascal programming language at school, I decided to choose it for writing code. The development environment was FormsABC - the training module of the program PascalABC.NET to work with the simplest windowed applications.
I decided to call a set of three programs "Information Security Bundle".

The first program of the kit was "Universal Coding Instrument" - a tool that allows you to encrypt any text, be it a personal message, password or just a set of letters. The encryption is done by applying a variation of the Caesar cipher I invented to the text. When encrypting a message, the user enters a text, and at the output receives an encrypted message and a special 20-character key. If the user wants to decrypt the message, then it is enough for him to enter the cipher and the key in special fields, after which he will receive the decrypted text. 

The second program I developed was "Password Master". The name of the application speaks for itself â€“ it is designed to check the password for reliability, as well as to generate secure passwords according to certain criteria.

The final, third program of the kit is the "Brute-Force List Generator". Most often, people use various combinations of words and numbers close to them in passwords. But what if a person forgot his password? Then the "Password List Generator" comes to the rescue. By entering the keywords and numbers that the password can consist of, you will get a list of all possible combinations, among which there will certainly be the one that you are trying to remember. A well-thought-out combinatorics system will allow you to make lists of thousands of combinations, and for the convenience of users, instructions are built into the program.
